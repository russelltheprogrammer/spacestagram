Note: This project was done for the Shopify Front End Developer Intern Challenge for Summer 2022

# The Challenge?

To build a webpage that can pull images, and allow the user to "like" and "unlike" their favourite images.

It should be simple. The main functions for the user interface are as followed.

1. Fetch data from one of NASA’s APIs and display the resulting images
2. Display descriptive data for each image (for example: title, date, description, etc.)
3. Like an image
4. Unlike an image


# Technical Requirements

1. Search results should come from NASA’s free APIs, for which you’ll need a free API from https://api.nasa.gov/
    - You do not need to enter anything more than your first, last name, and email address (i.e. application url is not required)
    - We’ve provided screenshots below of demo apps we built using the [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://api.nasa.gov/#apod) or Mars Rover Photos APIs (along with Shopify’s open source React component library: Polaris).
    - You are free to use any NASA API you like
    - You are free to use any front end framework/component library you like (or none at all!)

2. Each image result should list at least a title, date of capture (ideally in earth_date) and a button to “like” that image.

3. Each image can be “liked”, and a user should be able to undo their “like”

4. The HTML that ends up being served client-side should be accessible and semantic (MDN reference)

# Extra

There is a lot to be improved on here, you can polish the required features by crafting a nicer design, or improve the app by adding new features! Choose something that you feel best showcases your passion and skills.

If you need inspiration, here are examples of what you can work on. If you work on these ideas,
<strong>we recommend choosing only one or two.</strong>

- Save likes if the user leaves or reloads the page
- Animate the “like” action (might we suggest a heart?)
- Add a loading state while we wait for NASA’s API to return data
- Create shareable links for each image
- Add a date-picker to be able to browse photos starting from a specific date
